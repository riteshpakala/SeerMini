/// Generic read-through cache with synchronous lock-protected reads and off-actor,
/// race-safe disk persistence.
///
/// Encapsulates the repeated `LockedValue<Value?> + FilePersistence` pattern shared
/// by `TableMutator` and `RegistryMutator`:
///
///  - **Read**: `cache.snapshot` is synchronous and never hops an actor.
///  - **Mutate**: call `cache.update(newValue)` inside the owning actor after
///    modifying the value, then `cache.saveAsync(newValue)` to persist off-actor.
///  - **First load**: `await cache.load { .init() }` suspends the calling actor
///    during the disk read so other work can proceed concurrently.
///
/// All disk I/O is routed through a `PersistenceActor` — one per cache instance —
/// so concurrent `saveAsync` calls are guaranteed never to race on the backing file.
