/// A cross-platform, thread-safe wrapper that protects a value with a POSIX
/// reader-writer lock (`pthread_rwlock_t`).
///
/// Unlike `LockedValue` (which uses `NSLock` — exclusive for every access),
/// this type allows **concurrent reads** while keeping **writes exclusive**.
/// This is the correct primitive for any value that is read far more often
/// than it is written — e.g. the partition table, registry, and HNSW snapshot
/// caches which are read on every search request but written only on index/delete.
///
/// API contract enforced at the type level:
/// - `withReadLock`  receives `T` (immutable) — multiple callers run simultaneously.
/// - `withWriteLock` receives `inout T` (mutable) — caller has exclusive access.
///
/// Available on both Apple platforms and Linux via swift-corelibs-foundation.
