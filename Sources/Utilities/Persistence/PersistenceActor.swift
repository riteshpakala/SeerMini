/// Serializes all disk I/O for a single file through Swift's actor model.
///
/// `FilePersistence.save` is not thread-safe: two concurrent calls writing to
/// the same URL race on `data.write(to:)` and on the `fileExists → createFile`
/// branch. Wrapping it in an actor guarantees serial execution per file without
/// blocking any thread — callers simply `await` the actor method and the Swift
/// runtime handles the hop.
///
/// One `PersistenceActor` is created per logical file:
///   - `SeerCache<Value>` owns one for the table and one for the registry.
///   - `PersonalHNSWMutator` owns one per `ownerId`.
