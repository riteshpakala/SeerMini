/// Memory-mapped binary store for HNSW node embeddings.
///
/// Replaces the in-memory `vectorBuffer: Data` approach used in Phase 1+2.
/// Instead of loading the full 4 GB (at 1M nodes) vector file into RAM at
/// startup, the file is mapped into the process's virtual address space.
/// The OS page cache loads only the pages touched during traversal —
/// typically 1–5% of nodes per query = 40–200 MB of physical RAM.
///
/// **Concurrency model:**
///
/// - Multiple readers (searches) may hold a read lock simultaneously via
///   `withReadAccess`. The `VectorAccessor` they receive is valid for the
///   duration of the closure.
/// - Writers (insert append, compact rewrite) acquire the write lock to
///   remap the file. Appends only acquire the write lock when the current
///   capacity is exhausted; within-capacity appends are lock-free (they write
///   to a region no reader has a pointer into yet).
/// - Compact (`rewrite(order:)`) always acquires the write lock, blocking
///   until all active searches finish before remapping.
///
/// **Shared-reference semantics:**
///
/// `HNSWVectorStore` is a class held inside an `HNSWGraph` struct. Struct
/// copies (e.g., `PartitionTable` snapshots) share the same store reference.
/// This is intentional — reads from snapshots access the live mmap'd data.
/// Only mutators (`TableMutator`, `PersonalHNSWMutator`) ever call `append`
/// or `rewrite`; they are always actor-isolated so there is no concurrent
/// write contention.
